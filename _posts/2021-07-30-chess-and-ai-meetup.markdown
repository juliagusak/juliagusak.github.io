I was thrilled to organize and moderate the **1st Chess & AI meetup** at the venue of the FIDE World Cup 2021, which brought together chess professionals and data scientists to discuss the latest advances in chess technology and their implications for the chess community.

Curious to know: 
- Why was Napoleon ashamed of his poor chess skills and why did he order forged recordings of games?
- How do modern grandmasters train with chess engines?
- What is under the hood of AI chess engines like Alpha Zero?
