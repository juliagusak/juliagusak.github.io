            Modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require significant memory to store weight, activations, and other intermediate tensors during training. Hence, many models don’t fit one GPU device or can be trained using only a small per-GPU batch size. This survey provides a systematic overview of the ap- proaches that enable more efficient DNNs training. We analyze techniques that save memory and make good use of computation and communication re- sources on architectures with a single or several GPUs. We summarize the main categories of strate- gies and compare strategies within and across cate- gories. Along with approaches proposed in the lit- erature, we discuss available implementations.

        <p class="description">
            Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on memory-limited GPUs is challenging, as storing intermediate activations often exceeds available memory. Re-materialization, a technique that preserves exact computations, addresses this by selectively recomputing activations instead of storing them. However, existing methods either fail to scale, lack generality, or introduce excessive execution overhead. We introduce HiRemate a hierarchical re-materialization framework that recursively partitions large computation graphs, applies optimized solvers at multiple levels, and merges solutions into a global efficient training schedule. This enables scalability to significantly larger graphs than prior ILP-based methods while keeping runtime overhead low. Designed for single-GPU models and activation re-materialization, HiRemate extends the feasibility of training networks with thousands of graph nodes, surpassing prior methods in both efficiency and scalability. Experiments on various types of networks yield up to 50-70% memory reduction with only 10-15% overhead, closely matching optimal solutions while significantly reducing solver time.

        <p class="description">
            We propose Rockmate to control the memory requirements when training PyTorch DNN models. Rockmate is an automatic tool that starts from the model code and generates an equivalent model, using a predefined amount of memory for activations, at the cost of a few re-computations. Rockmate automatically detects the structure of computational and data dependencies and rewrites the initial model as a sequence of complex blocks. We show that such a structure is widespread and can be found in many models in the literature (Transformer based models, ResNet, RegNets,...). This structure allows us to solve the problem in a fast and efficient way, using an adaptation of Checkmate (too slow on the whole model but general) at the level of individual blocks and an adaptation of Rotor (fast but limited to sequential models) at the level of the sequence itself. We show through experiments on many models that Rockmate is as fast as Rotor and as efficient as Checkmate, and that it allows in many cases to obtain a significantly lower memory consumption for activations (by a factor of 2 to 5) for a rather negligible overhead (of the order of 10% to 20%). Rockmate is open source and available at https://github.com/topal-team/rockmate.

            Memory footprint is one of the main limiting factors for large neural network training. In backpropagation, one needs to store the input to each operation in the computational graph. Every modern neural network model has quite a few pointwise nonlinearities in its architecture, and such operations induce additional memory costs that, as we show, can be significantly reduced by quantization of the gradients. We propose a systematic approach to compute optimal quantization of the retained gradients of the pointwise nonlinear functions with only a few bits per each element. We show that such approximation can be achieved by computing an optimal piecewise-constant approximation of the derivative of the activation function, which can be done by dynamic programming. The drop-in replacements are implemented for all popular nonlinearities and can be used in any existing pipeline. We confirm the memory reduction and the same convergence on several open benchmarks.

            Tensor decomposition of convolutional and fully-connected layers is an effective way to reduce parameters and FLOP in neural networks. Due to memory and power consumption limitations of mobile or embedded devices, the quantization step is usually necessary when pre-trained models are deployed. A conventional post-training quantization approach applied to networks with decomposed weights yields a drop in accuracy. This motivated us to develop an algorithm that finds tensor approximation directly with quantized factors and thus benefit from both compression techniques while keeping the prediction quality of the model. Namely, we propose to use Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition with factors whose elements lie on a specified quantization grid. We compress neural network weights with a devised algorithm and evaluate it's prediction quality and performance. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods and demonstrate competitive results and high flexibility in achiving a desirable quality-performance tradeoff.

            Most state of the art deep neural networks are overparameterized and exhibit a high computational cost. A straightforward approach to this problem is to replace convolutional kernels with its low-rank tensor approximations, whereas the Canonical Polyadic tensor Decomposition is one of the most suited models. However, fitting the convolutional tensors by numerical optimization algorithms often encounters diverging components, i.e., extremely large rank-one tensors but canceling each other. Such degeneracy often causes the non-interpretable result and numerical instability for the neural network fine-tuning. This paper is the first study on degeneracy in the tensor decomposition of convolutional kernels. We present a novel method, which can stabilize the low-rank approximation of convolutional kernels and ensure efficient compression while preserving the high-quality performance of the neural networks. We evaluate our approach on popular CNN architectures for image classification and show that our method results in much lower accuracy degradation and provides consistent performance.

            Active subspace is a model reduction method widely used in the uncertainty quantification community. Firstly, we employ the active subspace to measure the number of" active neurons" at each intermediate layer and reduce the number of neurons from several thousands to several dozens, yielding to a new compact network. Secondly, we propose analyzing the vulnerability of a neural network using active subspace and finding an additive universal adversarial attack vector that can misclassify a dataset with a high probability.

            Normalization is an important and vastly investigated technique in deep learning. However, its role for Ordinary Differential Equation based networks (neural ODEs) is still poorly understood. This paper investigates how different normalization techniques affect the performance of neural ODEs. Particularly, we show that it is possible to achieve 93% accuracy in the CIFAR-10 classification task, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported accuracy among neural ODEs tested on this problem.
